# MageAttack
A.I. Game with HTML, CSS and JS

## This game was entirely created with the help of artificial intelligence and is currently in its Alpha stage. It was developed as part of a challenge proposed by the YouTube channel Andr√© Young, which consisted of recreating the game Seraph's Last Stand using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All the code, design, and mechanics were generated and refined with AI support, resulting in an experimental, creative, and innovative project. We are still testing and improving the gameplay based on community feedback.
